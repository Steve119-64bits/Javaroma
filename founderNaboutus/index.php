                <p class="des">Motivated by a profound love for coffee that she developed while studying culinary arts
                    in Italy,
                    Karina Winter came back to Malaysia with the intention of spreading the genuine coffee experience
                    that
                    she had grown to adore. She created JavaRoma, a brand that reflects her devotion to quality and
                    gives
                    Malaysians a taste of gourmet coffee made from carefully chosen beans, by fusing her expertise with
                    a
                    commitment to sustainability.<br><span class="quote">"Coffee is more than just a beverage; it's a
                        connection to the land, the farmers,
                        and the communities that nurture it. My mission is to bring that connection to every cup we
                        serve." - Karina Winter</span></p>

                <p><span class="bold">Karina Winter</span> left for Italy in 2010 and spent several years there
                    perfecting her culinary abilities,
                    with a concentration on coffee. By 2015, she had developed a thorough understanding of everything
                    related
                    to coffee, from bean selection to brewing methods. She dreamed of bringing a similar experience back
                    to her
                    native country of Malaysia in 2016, having been inspired by the rich coffee culture she had
                    encountered. She
                    formally established JavaRoma in 2018 after two years of painstaking planning and locating premium
                    beans, and
                    she soon became well-known for her dedication to sustainability and quality. JavaRoma is a living
                    example of her
                    enthusiasm and commitment to provide Malaysians the best coffee experiences possible."</p>
